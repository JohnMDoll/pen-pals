You just click on some stuff and type out whatever you want to say then it gets posted up on the page for everyone to see, but also you can say what the topics for your message are and they're kind of like emojis except they're totally words. It's crazy. Anyway, I'm the 2nd person to post anything, so I'll always be better than you, so remember that. Anyway, Yogi>Charlie.",
